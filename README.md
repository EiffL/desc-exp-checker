# Exposure Checker

This project provides a web-app for crowdsourced image quality control for LSST DESC. The app loads and displays FITS images directly in the browser and works on desktop and mobile devices. Users are asked to identify features in survey images, which are recorded and tracked. The LSST implementation is based off of the [DES exposure checker](https://github.com/pmelchior/des-exp-checker). More details can be found in [Melchior et al., Astron.Comput., 16, 99 (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26C....16...99M).

The license is MIT. Feel free to use and modify, but please cite our paper if you do.

## Installation

The app requires a webserver (tested on apache and nginx) with PHP and SQLite support. Then:

1. Clone the repository and go into the new directory.
2. Create two empty database files `files.db` and `users.db`:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 files.db < sql/files.sql
   sqlite3 users.db < sql/users.sql
   ```

   Move the db files into a directory that the webserver can access but that is hidden from direct access. Because of `.htaccess`, files and directories that start with a `.` are inaccessible when requested through the webserver, so you do:

   ````bash
   mkdir .db
   mv files.db users.db .db/
   ````
   
3. Load information about the test images into the file database. As you can see from the schema in `sql/files.sql`,  each image requires 4 pieces of information:

   ```sql
   expname TEXT,
   ccd TEXT,
   band TEXT,
   name TEXT
   ```

   `ccd` and `band` should be obvious, `expname` is the short but unique name of the exposure, and `name` (as a bit of a misnomer) is actually the filename of the FITS file in question. No full paths are needed, you'll set them in  `$config['fitspath']` next.

4. Edit `config.php.inc` as needed (see below). If you want to start fresh, check out `config.php.template`.
5. Add the new release to `release_selector.shtml`.
6. On a production environment: Remove `.git`, `config.php.template`, and `README.md`.
7. Run `fix_permissions.sh` to update file permission:

   ```bash
   ./fix_permissions.sh
   ```
   
## Configuration

### Config.php.inc

This file contains almost all of the particular configuration for the server and the location of files. Its content is:

```php
$config = array(
    "adminemail" => T_STRING,   // email address used for contact
    "adminname" => T_STRING,    // name used for admin emails
    "domain" => T_STRING,       // webserver domain name
    "releases" => T_ARRAY,	    // list of available releases
    "userdb" => T_STRING,       // path to the user database
    "filedb" => T_ARRAY,        // release => path to file database
    "fovpath" => T_ARRAY,       // release => path to FoV images
    "fitspath" => T_ARRAY       // release => path to fits files
    "images_per_fp" => T_INT,   // size of focal plane, used for congrats
    "release" => NULL,          // empty, set later
    "problem_code" => T_ARRAY   // problem label => numeric code
);
```

The code has a mechanism to switch between data releases. For that define a list of releases, e.g.

```php
 "releases" => array("SVA1", "Y1A1")
```

 Set the arrays for `filedb`, `fovpath`,`fitspath` with one key-value pair for each release, e.g.

```php
"filedb" => array("SVA1" => ".db/files.sva1.db",
                  "Y1A1" => ".db/files.y1a1.db")
```

### Releases

Open the file `release_selector.shtml` and modify as needed. The name of each release must be the content of HTML node of `class="release-button"` like

```html
<a class="release-button" href="#">SVA1</a>
```

### Problem classes

Problem classes are defined in two different locations: As textual labels for frontend users and as numbers for the server (the reduce overhead and storage requirements in the file databases).

1. Open `problem_selector.shtml` and modify as needed. For a label to be working as intended, it needs to be the content of an HTML node of `class="problem"`, e.g.

   ```html
   <a class="problem" href="#">Column mask</a>
   ```

2. Open `config.php.inc` again and make sure each problem label has a numeric code in `$config['problem_code']`, e.g.

   ```php
   $config['problem_code'] = array(
   	"OK" => 0, // DO NOT CHANGE!
       "Other..." => 999,  // DO NOT CHANGE!
       "Awesome!" => 1000, // DO NOT CHANGE!
       "Column mask" => 1,
       ...
       )
   ```

## API

In addition to the frontend statistics pages, user generated reports can be queried with an API. The path is

```
api.php?release=SVA1&problem=Column%20mask
```

The parameter `release` needs to be from `$config['releases']` and problem needs to be a key in `$config['problem_codes']`. If necessary, both need to be urlencoded.

The API returns JSON of the following form:

```javascript
[
  {"qa_id": number,
  "expname": string,
  "ccd": number,
  "band": string,
  "problem": string,
  "x": number,
  "y": number,
  "detail": null or string,
  "false_positive": true or false,
  "release": string
  }
]
```

The list has one of dictionary per reported problem that matches the request. `qa_id` is a unique identifier of the report in the given `release`, `x/y` are the CCD coordinates of the center of the problem marker, `detail` (only set for labels "Otherâ€¦" and "Awesome!") is a user-generated text to describe the report.

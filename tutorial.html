      <h3>Cosmic rays</h3>
      <p>They are an inevitable contaminant to images from our deep red-sensitive CCDs, so the
      problem is not that they are there. It's when they are not properly masked.
      The good thing about them: they are easy to spot. Use the display options
      to select of fairly bright setting,
      e.g. <button id="peter-button" class="btn btn-primary btn-mini">Peter's</button>,
      and they will be very apparent. Toggle the mask to find out if all have been
      found and whether they are entirely masked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <button class="btn btn-info" href="#" id="toggle-mask-button">Toggle mask</button>
        <button class="btn btn-info" href="#" id="option-button">Display options</button>
      </p>
      <p>It's perfectly fine to mark multiple cosmic rays per image, or
      multiple different problems on the same image. If you want to redo your selection,
      simply clear the markings from the image. If you're satisfied, save it and move
      on the the next image.

      <h3>Ghosts</h3>
      <p>Ghost are reflections of the optics, basically an undesired additional path
      from the outside of the telescope to CCD. They occur all the time,
      but only show up if a bright object provides enough illumination for this
      extra optical path. Then, often very large areas (from parts of a chip to the
      entire focal plane) show ring-like features, which are brighter than the
      surrounding sky. Whether ghosts are of concern depends strongly on the kind
      of science analysis you're after. In either case, we need to know where they are.

    <div class="span7">
      <h3>Cross-talk</h3>
      <p>Cross-talk is a readout issue, which occurs in the electronics.
      <span style="color:red">More detail here...</span>
      The visual imprint of cross-talk is a long, horizontal excess of counts,
      typically several pixels wide and often widest in the middle section.
      When the cross-talk
      occurs on a single chip, there should be a bright object on the other side
      of the horizontal A/B transition.
      </p>
      <p>Since cross-talk scales with the brightness of the object that
      cause it, only the brightest objects (typically stars) will leave a clearly
      visible imprint. Switch to <button class="btn btn-primary btn-mini">Arcsinh</button>
      scaling, and potentially <button class="btn btn-primary btn-mini">Reset</button> the
      visible range, to dig deeper into noise. Since the feature can be very extended,
      mark the region where it has it's largest vertical extension: the knot in the middle.

    </div>
    
    <div class="span7">
      <h3>Satellite tracks</h3>
      <p>Satellite or planes are expected to cross our focal plane several times per hour.
      They create long streaks on the images, much longer and wider than cosmic rays. Since they are so
      large, you can mark the track whereever you want. Sometimes, however, 
      the tracks are broken into segments (remember: planes have blinking lights), in which
      case we'd like to have marks on each of the segments.

    <div class="span7">
      <h3>Readout artifact</h3>
      <p>There are additional readout glitches, which can simply be found by looking
      for horizontal (= readout direction) features, almost always exactly one pixel
      wide. Mark it where it is most evident on the image.
      <span style="color:red">More detail here...</span>

        <small>Unmasked readout glitch (top). In addition, there is also a cosmic ray hit and a fainter cross-talk.</small>
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="span7">
      <h3>Catastrophic failures</h3>
      <p>Sometimes a large portion of the entire image is affected by, well, something.
      It would be too bothersome to mark each single feature on such an image, and
      even if, it would probably be hard to train a piece of software to distinguish between
      the contaminated parts and the usable rest. So, we'll settle for finding them first.
      </p>
      <p>Before marking an image as catastrophic failure, please make sure that it is not just
      a conincidence of several other features. As a guideline, estimate the remaining usable
      area after everything problematic has been masked (which may or may not be the case in
      the image you're are looking at). If this remainder is less than 50%, mark the image
      as catastrophic.</p>

    <div class="span7">
      <h3>Other...</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, none of the other categories fit. In this case, you can
      describe the problem in your own words. Please do so in a way that is understandable inasmuch
      as possible. We will attempt to categorize the problems you have identified later, and incorporate
      reocurring issues for later versions of this application.

      <p>The <a href="viewer.html">Viewer</a> displays an image from a single DECam CCD for you to inspect.
      If there are no obvious issues with the image, simply press "Next". 
      If not, click the "This is..." button and select one of the predefined artifacts. 
      Click on the location of the artifact to mark it on the image.
      Once you are done marking artifacts, click "Next".

      <h3>Column Mask</h3>
      <p> There are a number of columns that behave differently than their neighbors.
        Often this occurs when a hot pixel in the column bleeds over during readout. 
        We attempt to mask these columns with a "bad pixel mask" and it is useful to know when we are missing bad columns.

      <h3>Mask Dots</h3>
      <b> I would remove this as a problem class (maybe add to an FAQ).</b>
      <p> Very hot pixels will overflow into downstream pixels during readout creating a "bad column".
        Additionally, cross talk creates hot pixels spaced every 60 pixels upstream (towards the readout side) of the hot pixels. 
        This appears as a dotted mask upstream of a truncated bad column mask.
        These dots are not actually a problem class.

      <a id="cross-talk-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Cross-talk</h3>
      <p>Cross-talk is a readout issue, which occurs in the electronics.
      The visual imprint of cross-talk is a long, horizontal excess of counts,
      typically several pixels wide and often widest in the middle section.
      When the cross-talk
      occurs on a single chip, there should be a bright object on the other side
      of the horizontal A/B transition.
      </p>
      <p>Since cross-talk scales with the brightness of the object that
      cause it, only the brightest objects (typically stars) will leave a clearly
      visible imprint. Toggle the image scaling to dig deeper into noise. Since the feature can be very extended,
      mark the region where it has it's widest vertical extension: the knot in the middle.

        A failure in flat-fielding can lead to one or more of these tape bumps being visible in the reduced image.

        Tree rings originate from variations in the doping impurities during single-crystal silicon growth.
        Thus, the tree ring pattern of each CCD will depend on its relative position in the silicon wafer.
        Tree rings appear most strongly in the z-band.

      <a id="vertical-jump-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Vertical jump</h3>
      <p>
        The vertical jump arises from the incorporation of a few bad flats into the calibration sets.
        These flats contain a strong gradient caused by the shutter failing to close during readout.
        Due to the clipping algorithm when combining multiple flats, this results in a vertical "jump" near the center of flat-fielded images.

      <h3>Failure</h3>
      <p>Sometimes a large portion of the entire image is affected by, well, something.
      It would be too bothersome to mark each single feature on such an image, and
      even if, it would probably be hard to train a piece of software to distinguish between
      the contaminated parts and the usable rest. So, we'll settle for finding them first.
      </p>
      <p>Before marking an image as catastrophic failure, please make sure that it is not just
      a conincidence of several other features. As a guideline, estimate the remaining usable
      area after everything problematic has been masked (which may or may not be the case in
      the image you're are looking at). If this remainder is less than 50%, mark the image
      as catastrophic.</p>

      <h3>Other...</h3>
      <p>Sometimes none of the existing categories fit. 
        In this case, you can describe the problem in your own words.
        Please do so in a way that is as comprehensible and consistent as possible (e.g., if you see feature multiple times, try to use the same description). 
        Later on, we will attempt to categorize the problems you have identified and incorporate recurring issues for later versions of this application.

      <h3>Awesome!</h3>
      <p>Rarely, you'll come across a truely phenomenal sight, maybe of a bunch of interacting galaxies
      or of a comet, a star cluster, etc. Please do report these objects by selecting "Awesome!" from the drop-down,
      then describe what you see and click on the object. We collect these objects, and present the most fabulous ones
      in our <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to help with the inspection of the candidates
      for our website and outreach purposes, please contact us.

    <h3>Can I help?</h3>
    Certainly. If you think you found a new class of artifacts, let us know. If you know where these artefacts come from, let us know. How? Go to <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Problem_classes_from_the_SV-A1_eyeball_website">the redmine wiki</a>, where we list and discuss such cases.
